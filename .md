âœ… Step-by-Step Guide
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Understand the Problem
Read about the Titanic dataset and what each column means.

Identify your target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Think: What might influence survival? (e.g., sex, class, age)

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Load the Dataset
Use pandas to load the dataset (usually from CSV).

Explore the first few rows using .head() to get a feel for the data.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understand the structure: .info(), .describe()

Check for missing values.

Plot distributions:

Count plots for categorical variables like Sex, Pclass.

Histograms for numerical variables like Age, Fare.

Look at survival rates across groups (e.g., Sex, Pclass).

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle Missing Data:

Fill or drop missing values for Age, Cabin, Embarked.

Feature Engineering:

Extract titles from names (e.g., Mr., Mrs.)

Create new features: FamilySize = SibSp + Parch

Convert categorical to numeric:

Use Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding for Sex, Embarked, etc.

Drop Unnecessary Columns:

E.g., PassengerId, Name, Ticket (unless useful)

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Split the Data
Split into features (X) and target (y).

Then split into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Train Your Models
Start simple:

Logistic Regression

Try more powerful ones:

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Fit models using your training data.

ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Evaluate Your Models
Use metrics like:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Compare model performance.

Analyze where your model makes wrong predictions.

ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Improve the Model (Optional)
Try:

Tuning hyperparameters.

Adding/removing features.

Feature scaling (for some models).

ðŸ”¹ Step 9: Final Prediction on Test Data
Use your best model to predict on the test set.

Interpret the results.

ðŸ”¹ Step 10: Document Your Work
Make a clean notebook or script with:

Comments and section titles.

Clear EDA, modeling, and conclusions.

Answer:

What helped your model?

What features were most important?

ðŸ”¹ Step 11: Reflect & Share
What did you learn about preprocessing and classification?

Can you explain why a random forest might outperform logistic regression?

Optionally: share the notebook or turn into a mini-report.
